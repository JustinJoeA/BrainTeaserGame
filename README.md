<h2>This is a project based on the game of Brain Age: Math</h2>
<br>
Back in my day, I love to test my math skill using the brain app that was automatically added to my nintendo. It has a several mathematics problem, such as the addition and substraction.
I was hooked, and now that I am a grown up, I tried to replicate that game from my childhood using JavaScript.
<br>
So here it is, my crude replica of the game, I will try to add more stylization into the future, but for the due time, this project is a part of my JavaScript learning roadmap.
